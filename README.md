genome assembly with ONT and iseq data

Unicycler is a tool for genome assembly with long reads and short reads data.
I have written a script using ChatGPT that automates the process of genome assembly.

Please notice your sample file name. 
The "S1" in the iSeq data must correspond to "barcode01" in the ONT data, and so on.
