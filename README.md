genome assembly with ONT and iseq data

Unicycler is a tool that allows for genome assembly using both long reads and short reads. 

I have written a script using ChatGPT that automates the process of genome assembly.

Please notice your sample file name. 

The "S1" in the iSeq data must correspond to "barcode01" in the ONT data, and so on.
